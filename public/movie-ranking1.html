<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Silent Voice</h3>
<p>This is a real tear jerker, and an amazing watch.</p>
<h3>Pokemon:Mewtwo returns(Or something like that idk)</h3>
<p>This was the best movie I had seen when I was a child.</p>
<h3>The last: Naruto the movie</h3>
<p>Honestly, a must watch if you have seen Naruto. Even watching the picture of that scene makes me very emotional.</p>
